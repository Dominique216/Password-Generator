# Password-Generator
## Description 
This web application is a password generator. The html and css was provided from UT Austin's Coding Bootcamp and the goal was to create a functioning password generator. In this app, the user must first select the generate password button. From there, they will receive five propmts. The first will ask how long they want thier password. The user must choose a number between 8 and 128. Then they will be asked if they would like to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, or special characters. If the user wants to include one of the options they will select yes, if not, they can select cancel. Once the questions are answered, the newly generated password will show on the page.
